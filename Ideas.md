### 🌿 Plants:
Plants can be acquired through a variety of ways: bought / traded, grown from seeds, or harvested from fully grown plants. Discovering new plants means learning the best environment for that plant. Plants have a range of basic requirements, these include: soils, water, and light. Plant health can be improved by: fertiliser or food, temperature, humidity, and insecticides and pest control.

### 🔬 Research:
Growing, caring for, and improving yeild and quality, requires research. To unlock research multiple tasks must be performed on cuttings taken from the plant at each stage of growth. Taking a cutting from the plant risks the plant dying with the probability of it dying directly related to the current research status. Once a plant has been fully researched, the ability to genetically modify the plant is unlocked.
   
### ⚙️ Crafting:
By using components, purchased, gifted, or found, the player can craft useful machines, tools, and upgrades.

### 🌐 Galactic Market:
Buying and selling goods on the galactic market is quicker than locating traders (with good reputation), but runs the risk of altering the price of the items being bought or sold. If buying or selling illegal goods, the player also risks the transaction being traced and alerting law enforcement (or equivalent). Run-ins with the law will also effect your reputation with groups depending on their social views.

### ⚖️ Reputation:
Repeat dealings with a group increases your reputation with them. However, reputations with other groups may change depending on their view of those you are dealing with. Low reputation will increase costs and decrease effectiveness of persuasion. Even lower reputation will result in hostility and being attacked. High reputation will lower prices and increase persuasion. Even higher reputation gives a chance of receiving gifts of plants, knowledge, or money.

### 🏛️ Legal Status:
Your legal status will change according to your decisions while playing the game.
