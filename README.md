# Astrobotany
Using your recently acquired botanical skills and harnessing the world's newest technology;  
faster-than-light travel, you set out on a business venture. Travel the galaxy, collecting,  
cataloguing, and trading new plants, all in the hopes of turning a profit.

# Tutorial
The tutorial follows the player after they enter the ship they have purchased from the auction for the first time.  
Showing the player how to pick up old broken machines or furniture to clean up. It then shows the player how to scrap  
those old machines for resources in the fabricator and how to craft new planters and other machines. Not all recipes  
would be unlocked at this point making the required machines the only possible things you could craft.  
The player would then move to the navigation section of the ship where an old conputer would turn on informing the  
player of the last destination left from the previous owner. Using the old destination the player would fly to the  
marked planet to find an old outpost...

# Gameplay
## Plants
Discovering and growing new plants requires adjusting their environment to better suit their needs. Plants  
have a range of basic requirements, these include: soils, water, and light. Plant health  
can be improved by applying fertiliser, adjusting temperatures and humidity, and using  
insecticides and pest control.
## Research
Growing, caring for, and improving yield / quality of plants requires research. To unlock research, multiple  
tasks must performed on samples taken from plants at each stage of growth. Taking a sample from a plant  
risks the plant dying with the probability of it dying related to the current research status. Once a plant  
has been fully researched, the ability to genetically modify the plant is unlocked.  
## Synthesis & Crafting
The fabricator is the main source of recipe crafting outside of extremely basic recipes. The fabricator allows  
for recycling of old or unwanted items into some of their original components with a small amount of loss.  
By using components; purchased, crafted, gifted, or found, the player can craft useful machines, tools, and upgrades.  
## Trade & Market
Buying and selling goods on the galactic market is quicker than locating traders  
(who are willing to trade), but runs the risk of altering the price of the items being bought or sold.  
*E.g. selling too many of a single item will drop the price that the item will sell for.*  
If buying or selling illegal goods, the player also risks the transaction being traced and alerting law  
enforcement (or equivalent). Run-ins with the law will also effect your reputation with groups depending on  
their social views.  
## Reputation
Repeat dealings with a group or faction changes your reputation with them. However, your reputation with  
other groupsmay change depending on their view of those you are interacting with. Low reputation increases  
costs when trading and decreases likelihood of persuasion. High reputation lowers prices and increases chances  
of persuasion. Even higher reputation gives a chance of gifts such as plants, knowledge, money, or access to  
unique quests.  
## Storage
Physical storage is required for managing inventories. All items have an in-world model which can be placed  
down in the ship or outside as decoration or with additional functionality.
